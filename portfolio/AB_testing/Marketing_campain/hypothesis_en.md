# A/B Testing: Impact of Advertising on Conversion

## Experiment Overview

This experiment aims to answer two key questions:

1. **Was the advertising campaign successful?**  
2. **If the campaign was successful, how much of that success can be attributed to the ads?**

To address these questions, we conduct an **A/B test**, where:
- **The experimental group** sees advertisements.
- **The control group** sees only a **Public Service Announcement (PSA)** or nothing.

The goal of this analysis is to assess **advertising effectiveness**, calculate the **additional revenue** generated by ads, and determine whether the difference between the groups is **statistically significant**.

## Data Structure

- **`user id`** – Unique identifier for the user.
- **`test group`** – Testing group (`ad` – saw advertisements, `psa` – saw only a public service announcement).
- **`converted`** – Whether the user made a purchase (`True/False`).
- **`total ads`** – The number of ads the user was exposed to.
- **`most ads day`** – The day of the week when the user saw the most ads.
- **`most ads hour`** – The hour of the day when the user saw the most ads.

This document outlines the **hypothesis**, success metrics, and potential risks of the experiment.

## Hypothesis Card

### **Problem Statement**
The company invests resources in advertising, but it is unclear whether it actually drives an increase in conversion. Without analysis, it is difficult to assess campaign effectiveness and make informed optimization decisions.

### **Objective**
Increase conversion in the test group by **X%** compared to the control group.

### **Hypothesis Implementation**
Launching advertisements for the **experimental group (Ad)** and public service announcements for the **control group (PSA)**. We analyze whether there is a statistically significant difference in conversion rates between these two groups.

### **Expected Results**
- If the hypothesis is confirmed, the conversion rate in the **Ad** group will be **significantly higher** than in the control group.
- If the hypothesis is not confirmed, the difference in conversion rates between groups will be **minimal or non-existent**.

### **Success Metrics**
- **Conversion Rate** – The proportion of users who made a purchase after viewing the advertisement.
- **P-value** – A statistical test to determine the significance of differences.
- **Δ Conversion Rate** – The difference in conversion between groups.

### **Reason for Testing**
The company needs to evaluate **advertising effectiveness** to make informed decisions regarding the marketing budget.

### **Risks**
- **Distortion of organic conversion** – Ads may attract users who would have made a purchase anyway.
- **Negative brand perception** – Excessive advertising exposure may lead to user fatigue.
- **Ignoring profitability thresholds** – The cost of acquiring customers may exceed the revenue generated.

### **Hypothesis**
**We believe that the advertising campaign increases conversion by 10% compared to the control group.**
